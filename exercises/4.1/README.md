# Exercise 4.1: Product placement

Your job is to define a function `Product`, which will return the result of multiplying its two inputs. For example:

```go
fmt.Println(product.Product(2, 3))
// 6
```

You'll also need to define a suitable type constraint for this function. Make sure it's broad enough to allow all the different numeric types supplied by the tests, but not _so_ broad that it doesn't allow you to implement the function!

If you have any trouble, refer to [Solution 4.1](../../solutions/4.1/product.go) for one possible answer.
